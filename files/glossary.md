## Front end Developer
A front end developer works on "front end" code in an application, commonly meaning the code that customers and product users interact with directly. A "front end dev" will typically write CSS, HTML and JavaScript in order to build complex interfaces for people to use. The front end development stack is always changing but tends to involve a front end library like Angular, React, Vue or Web components and a lot of backend knowledge in "tooling" like yarn / npm.

## Accessibility / A11y

Accessibility is creating a website that can be used by all people, no matter how they get the information from the site. Some examples of ways people need special accomdendations to browse sites include:

* voice over
* keyboard controls
* audio file transcripts
* alternative text for images

Implementing accessibility is important because just like busniess are required to make their space usable for all people, including those with disabilies, websites must be avaible to all people to use. Some tools developers can use to manage accssibility inclde Lighthouse, and WAVE.
