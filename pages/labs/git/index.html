<h2 id="header-05abde5d-a04e-9310-aaf4-e0b79c5fc348">Scenario</h2>
<p>Something silly trolling the fact that we are FINALLY back in person. Basically just that you have to make a git repo and github is a great place to do it!</p>
<h2 id="header-833392a3-70b1-c39b-3842-2f44249b8934">Deliverable</h2>
<ul><li>You’re going to make a git repo, gitlab service, or CI driven website (which is a git repo)</li>
<li>You’re going to do a blog post explaining the concept in the option selected</li>
<li>A matching video that demonstrates a concept from the option selected (like using Github Desktop to make a commit in the video as an example)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="header-c7cf2cb4-fde5-1552-7b96-2e1b5293c52e">Option 1</h3>
<ul><li>Demonstrate the multiple ways that git can interface with a website through different UIs (at least 2)</li>
<li>Use command line, VS Code git plugin, the github website, or Github Desktop as a backdrop for explaining version control and how a “commit” from each of these use git to keep the code changes in sync</li>
<li>Do a blog post about how the video / these different methods of making commits is similar to a team all collaborating on a git repository</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="header-a963d567-1739-c109-a469-111b65f6590b">Option 2</h3>
<ul><li>Building a basic website with HAX11ty</li>
<ul><li>https://github.com/elmsln/hax11ty</li>
<li>If you used dev.to you can copy and paste your old blog posts to make a site that has all of them in one place</li>
</ul>
<li>Need to use hax11ty as a template repo (it’s like forking)</li>
<ul><li>I’ll demo what to edit to make this possible, it's pretty easy</li>
</ul>
<li>Explain briefly what haxcms + 11ty is</li>
<li>Use github actions to deploy your site to github pages</li>
<li>Explain github actions and show it's steps running through when you make a change to your repo in your video (main point)</li>
<li>Your blog post is the steps to setup hax11ty​​ and your experience with making a simple blog to host all your posts using it</li>
<ul><li>This is a mash up of our tech + github CI + 11ty a static site system</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h3 id="header-0f7d68ee-e532-0373-95d4-768d9fb00b7e">Option 3</h3>
<ul><li>Setup a copy of gitlab on a local machine or live server</li>
<li>Explain what gitlab / version control products like this provide</li>
<li>Highlight features of gitlab by starting a repo in your own gitlab instance</li>
<li>Your blog post should teach people the steps to install and deploy their own gitlab, a bit about how it works and it's background</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="header-0592d313-3c45-0584-3cdd-d1027afb8e8f">Submission</h2>
<ul><li>Create the post, link to you video in the post</li>
<li>Submit link to post in <b>#lab-5-git</b>
 channel on Slack</li>
<li><b>This is due by Sunday at 11:59pm</b>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="header-40c96780-c65d-e9d1-70b2-dddb1543089f">Rubric</h2>
<ul><li>Did you do the lab activity (34%)</li>
<li>Did you do your blog post writing about your option (33%)</li>
<li>Demonstration of technique in video (33%)</li>
<li>Evaluation is contextual based on which option you pick.</li>
</ul>
