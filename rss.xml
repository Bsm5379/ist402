          <![CDATA[ <h3 id="header-bc5b3d65-6131-6cb8-274a-7291fefee156">Scenario</h3>
<ul><li>There are websites on the internet that are not made up to snuff for accessibility and that makes people without screens mad</li>
<li>Beyond mad, it makes them unable to actually use your product / website</li>
<li>This is both bad to do to a human being and stupid; you want their cash regardless of how they use your website!</li>
<li>But if only there were ways of learning how to improve the accessibility and SEO of a website at the same time...</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="header-7ba5b74c-b1ff-d6de-18bc-79dcc0f4d062">Deliverable</h3>
<ul><li>Perform a web.dev / lighthouse and WAVE audit on a website</li>
<li>Review the feedback it gives and identify three areas for improvement from the audit that were things you didn’t know about before</li>
<li>Research (Google) how to solve these things and propose potential solutions to the problems</li>
<li>These problems can be SEO / A11y / Performance related; anything that’s given by the reports that you can interpret, research and then write / do a video about how to resolve</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="header-6869354b-dd1c-46fe-7670-a1e78b49cf4c">Option 1</h3>
<ul><li>Audit a website for a club, small business or other website affiliated with you or important to you in some way</li>
<li>This could also be something you don’t care about, just has to be something that generates meaningful data to analyze</li>
<li>Write on dev.to or hax.psu.edu for this option</li>
<li>If you own the site and can fix it this would make for an even more powerful / actionable way to solve this</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="header-de46fb17-799f-7128-ace9-6626fd21eb30">Option 2</h3>
<ul><li>Audit a specific page in the course website or using hax.psu.edu to make a basic hello-world page</li>
<li>Do your write up in our team’s issue queue <a href="https://github.com/elmsln/issues/issues">https://github.com/elmsln/issues/issues</a>
</li>
<li>By doing this you’ll help our projects (which are big while team is small) and improve your own SEO footprint via github posting / cross posting</li>
<ul><li>next week we’ll get into github so this is a look ahead</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h3 id="header-89aae1e2-67ac-990c-e170-c5990ec7db37">Submission</h3>
<ul><li>Create the post, link to you video in the post</li>
<li>Submit link to post in <b>#lab4-a11y-seo</b>
 channel on Slack</li>
<li>This is due by Sunday at 11:59pm</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="header-cdd790e1-47ee-740f-6380-1149218a4c3d">Rubric</h3>
<ul><li>Did you run a Lighthouse / web.dev / WAVE audit  (20%)</li>
<li>Did you write / research 3 areas for improvement (40%)</li>
<li>Did you do a video explaining the process / how to use these tools and what they are (40%)</li>
<li>Evaluation is contextual based on which option you pick.</li>
</ul>

<li>Write up your thought process for selecting how your component should function</li>

      <title>W4 Improving your digital identity</title>
      <link>/labs/improving-your-digital-identity</link>
      <description>
          <![CDATA[ <p>This week we're going to improve upon our brand through critique and self reflection. We want to get our brands in as good a shape as possible prior to all the hands on labs and topics we'll be engaging in this semester.</p>
<h2 id="header-269a6260-4d70-a51e-cc8a-d6dffd873f11">Critique</h2>
<p>Look to the people around you in class (say hi, scary, I know). Ask what their brand is (ask three people), find it on the <b>#lab-1-brand </b>
Slack<b> </b>
channel to find them on YouTube. Watch their video for the git submission last week. Take note of the following and offer them suggestions on where they can improve:</p>
<ul><li>Brand name / recognition</li>
<li>Style in video / audio quality / space used to record</li>
<li>Usage of social media (if any)</li>
<li>Images in headers and icon form on YouTube/Github/Social Media</li>
<li>Video descriptions, links in the description area</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="header-be5954b0-84ee-1912-656f-567e8eb0c229">Writing</h2>
<p>I want you to produce <b>recommendations for each of the three brands</b>
 you selected on how they can improve their brand (these can be bullet points / short sentences on each of the points above).<b> Take the feedback for each brand and use the "Thread" feature of slack to post the suggestions to them in the #lab-1-brand channel (since everyone posted there already)</b>
</p>
<img src="files/Screenshot from 2020-01-22 17-07-35.png" alt="Shows the UI in slack which has the thread button and what that pops open to look like." style="width: 100%;"/><h2 id="header-a3d87fca-be82-b07c-e3bf-fc517040d429">Video Reflection</h2>
<p>For your video reflection I want you to produce a video explaining one of the topics related to our guest speaker as well as reflecting on the feedback you got from classmates. Start your video by discussing ways you could improve your brand's SEO via these changes as SEO is related to how well google and others can index your content so others can find it.</p>
<p>After you reflect on the feedback and how you plan to implement it, talk about one of these topics below. I've included a list of potential questions to answer throughout your explainer video to help you find things to google / form discussion points..</p>
<ul><li><b>SEO</b>
 - Search engine optimization. How SEO influences you showing up in search engine results? What can you do to improve your SEO? What are some things you can do this semester to ensure you have high SEO when we're done? Finding links that explain the subject either from technical (HTML structure / metadata) or from a marketer perspective.</li>
<li><a href="https://oerschema.org">OERSchema</a>
 - What a schema is, what OER Schema is trying to achieve, and showing an example from the documentation and explaining it. This can be anything related to micro-data, how it interplay with SEO and search indexing, or even privacy concerns associated with being able to associate public data a bit too accurately.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="header-2e9caccb-cc0e-c954-3176-61f57c6455ea">Rubric</h2>

          <![CDATA[ <p>Slides on containers by me and @hey__mp</p>
<p>Containers are transforming the landscape of the web and what's possible in application development at scale. Companies like Google, Netflix, Uber, Canvas and more are only possible because of the raw power of container and container orchestration technology.</p>
<p>This week we'll explore containers using the web service <a href="https://labs.play-with-docker.com/">Play with Docker</a>
, a great resource that gives you infrastructure for 4 hours at a time without needing to pay anything.</p>
<p>Our guest speaker, former Penn State graduate <a href="https://twitter.com/hey__mp">Michael Potter</a>
 will show us many different use cases for containers using <a href="https://docker.com">Docker</a>
. He'll give you a behind the scenes look at the container infrastructure he's building to deliver high quality online course experiences at Eberly College of Science using an advanced container publishing workflow.</p>

          <![CDATA[ <p>For lab this week, we'll use directions our guest has put together to deploy different services via docker to better understand Functions as a Service technology as well as a bit of how docker infrastructure works.</p>
<h2 id="header-fb318d99-cfde-f4fa-1d65-cbcdfd792f63">Setting up Ubuntu</h2>
<p>We'll do this in class using <a href="https://labs.play-with-docker.com/">Play with Docker</a>
.</p>
<h2 id="header-241c2cb9-4783-8c8f-76e5-e497cef4d837">Drupal</h2>
<p>We'll do this in class together. Let's <a href="https://github.com/heyMP/ist402-docker/tree/master/labs/4-drupal">setup Drupal</a>
 in Play with Docker. We know what it took to install Drupal on "shared hosting" / Cpanel; now let's get a step closer to how the pro's would be deploying and managing Drupal at scale.</p>
<h2 id="header-6d92ad95-bdec-0430-ba50-2ad8bb6dd167">OpenFaaS</h2>
<p>OpenFaaS is an open source functions as a service platform for building your own function based microservice endpoints. <a href="https://github.com/heyMP/ist402-docker/tree/master/labs/6-openfaas">Follow the directions in this repo</a>
 to setup OpenFaaS on <a href="https://labs.play-with-docker.com/">Play with Docker</a>
.</p>
<h2 id="header-89a8d03f-4925-dd9d-ae3a-b43e50f59a51">Deliverable</h2>
<p>This week I want you to try your hand at one of the following (or combinations in the video). As usual you can solve this how it makes sense to you <b>but I want you to be demonstrating how to install things in Play with Docker and what that looks like. This forms the backdrop for you to talk about why this is transformational.</b>
</p>
<ul><li>Install OpenFaaS in Play with Docker and explain why functions as a service are the future of infrastructure. This could be done showing one of the functions we covered in class and relating it to how Uber spins up a service to track your location and relay it to the drive (as one example).</li>
<li>Find a diagram to explain Docker and the difference between it and Virtual Machine technology, explaining why containers are the future of technology backed businesses. Install Drupal in Play with Docker and get it to the install screen. (It has issues at times getting past this phase as this is just a demo)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="header-3de98455-e730-ce1d-2e34-2bb4cbe566e0">Submission</h2>
<p>Add your video to the <b>#lab-11-docker</b>
 slack channel.</p>
<h2 id="header-e34fa9b8-704e-50b2-baeb-e85e2e410771">Evaluation rubric</h2>
<ul><li>Did you demonstrate <i>installing an application in Play with Docker</i>
? <b>(5pts)</b>
</li>
<li>Did you explain the importance of Container technology either via the difference between Containers and Virtual Machines or why the Functions as a Service approach is such a big deal, with visuals backing it up? <b>(5pts)</b>

      <title>W13 Accessible Design</title>
      <link>/labs/lab-12-accessible-design</link>
      <description>
          <![CDATA[ <p>You live in the world of Stranger Things. I know, it's hard to envision, it's why it's such a good show. Old people like your instructor, actually remember parts of the 80s and what it was like to not know where people were at all times.</p>
<grid-plate style="width: 100%;" breakpoint-sm="900" breakpoint-md="1200" breakpoint-lg="1500" breakpoint-xl="1800" layout="1-1" responsive-size="xl" hide-ops>  <p slot="col-1">Anyway. A lost art from the 80s was designing for interfaces that were primitive. Often times years would be lost trying to design simple things like joysticks and monitors to present primitive games with only a few options. But, these systems are universally approachable and the constrains put on the technology of the day helped inform this.</p>
  <meme-maker slot="col-2" alt="home video running GIF" image-url="https://media3.giphy.com/media/Z71HSa4vBWlW/giphy.gif" top-text="1 stick, no btnz" bottom-text="best game evrz" imageurl="https://media3.giphy.com/media/Z71HSa4vBWlW/giphy.gif" toptext="home video running GIF" style="width: 75%; margin: 0px auto; display: block;">

    <div>best game evrz</div></meme-maker>
</grid-plate>
<p>Now we live in a world without constraints which often leads to less accessible, less usable experiences. That's where you come in...</p>
<p>Today, we're going to design an interface or interaction that would be heavily steeped in constraints in order to envision more accessible systems. Take an application like twitter, remove the screen, the auto updating and self refreshing interfaces, remove the trolling and memes; how would people be able to leverage twitter effectively. What prompts would make sense on a command line, or on a simple 1999 style website (text box, click to submit data, that's about it).</p>
<p>Twitter is too easy an example which is why I'm spelling it out here: that's because the 140 character limit previously on twitter was because it was envisioned as a way of initially bridging cellphones to contribute to the web. People would "log into twitter" by texting a special number and that text === tweet. Laughable to think about now, but it was the original design and simplicity that was possible via constraint based design.</p>
<h2 id="header-b564170f-73d4-49b1-43c3-32285b5d71cc">Now it's your turn</h2>
<p>Think of an interface you use (inventory management in a game, registering for a course, shopping online).</p>
<p>Now imagine that interface existed as a text-based computer program from the <b>1980s</b>
. How would you communicate visual elements and order items logically? The text-based story to make the initial design.  This will help you think about screen readers first.</p>
<p>Now imagine that the interface existing in the early <b>1990s</b>
 as only HTML. What HTML elements would you need? This will help you think about progressive enhancement (and making sites work without too much javascript).</p>
<p>Make a video explaining how an interface of your choice would look in 1980 and in 1990 and what aspects should carry forward to the modern web.</p>

<p>Create a new HAXcms / CMS site of your choice, create page(s) named for the technology / interface you are going to imagine in the 80s and 90s (1 for each).</p>
<p>Write a paragraph about the technology / link to media associated with it so everyone knows exactly what it is. Then write a a few paragraphs about how this process and interface could be translated to 80s, command prompt style technology. Then write the same narrative but if you were to be able to design and visualize this using 90s technology or basic html / Netscape Navigator style web.</p>
<p>Record a 5 minute video explaining the technology <i>and limiting factors</i>
 that would be taken into account if it was replicated in the 80s or 90s context. This could be done talking over very rough mock ups / user flow diagrams in <a href="https://draw.io/" target="_blank">draw.io</a>

          <![CDATA[ <p>Web accessibility is just one piece of the accessibility pie but we're attuned to its importance. The next thing though is how do we use tools to help build more accessible things and remediate what we already have?</p>
<h2>Prelab / in class doing</h2>
<p>Let's install the <b>WAVE Evaluation Tool</b>
 and <b>Lighthouse</b>
 plugins for Chrome / Firefox.</p>
<p>Let's work through some accessibility issues in a code pen to get some basics down</p>
<p>Codepen: <a href="https://stackblitz.com/edit/a11y-issues?file=index.html" style="font-family: var(--haxcms-base-styles-body-font-family, &quot;Noto Serif&quot;, serif); letter-spacing: var(--haxcms-base-styles-body-letter-spacing, 0.5px);">https://stackblitz.com/edit/a11y-issues?file=index.html</a>
</p>
<p>Let's check out these websites and read through the <b>Lighthouse score and WAVE </b>
to understand issues and see what real reports look and feel like</p>

<h2>Lab Scenario</h2>
<p>You are a consultant bring brought in to help out a web team organized by someone with <b>your exact name</b>
, that has a site builder with <b>the same name</b>
, and oddly a developer also with... the <b>same name</b>
 (weird..)! You work at A11y for All inc (great company name...) and you are here because of concerns by the web team that past projects were not correctly audited for performance and accessibility.<span> (WTF?! WHY DIDN'T THE INSTRUCTOR TELL US TO AUDIT OUR STUFF ALONG THE WAY).</span></p>
<p>Your CEO, Admiral Akbar is <i><b>piiiiiiiiiiiist</b>
</i>
</p>
<meme-maker alt="its a trap GIF by Star Wars" image-url="https://media3.giphy.com/media/3ornka9rAaKRA2Rkac/giphy.gif" top-text="No audits?" imageurl="https://media3.giphy.com/media/3ornka9rAaKRA2Rkac/giphy.gif" toptext="its a trap GIF by Star Wars" style="width: 75%; margin: 0px auto; display: block;"></meme-maker>
<p>"It's ok though CEO Akbar", you assure the CEO, "you're paying our exorbitant rates to solve this problem for you. We'll even teach your team how to solve these problems to avoid issues in the future!"</p>

<h2>Lab what to do</h2>
<ul><li>Audit any of the past CMS projects using <b>Lighthouse</b>
 and <b>WAVE</b>
</li>
<li>If there's anything simple in content that you can fix, remediate it, but the goal here is understanding how to interpret the reports and explain how the problems found can be remediated.</li>
<li>Use your past HAXcms site to add a page of content with screenshots of your lighthouse scores</li>
<li>On that page, put your video explaining the following..</li>
</ul>
<h2>Video what to cover</h2>
<p>For your video I want you to <b>explain how you ran an accessibility and performance audit of a website</b>
. This can be one of the websites your worked on in class OR (and probably more meaningful) perform this audit on a club, organization or other website that's associated with you or that you can actually have an impact on by running this audit and providing feedback.</p>
<p>Make sure to explain what the audit is, why it's important, and then a bit about how the site can leverage the scores to make improvements. Don't just say "it needs to improve accessibility" take at least one of the points and explain what a remediation would look like in order to improve. This can be from the WAVE or Lighthouse feedback.</p>
<h2>Submission Rubric</h2>
<p>Ran reports and posted screenshots to HAXcms site <b>(4 pts)</b>
</p>
<p>Recorded a video accurately explaining what the reports generate and how they are useful <b>(6 pts)</b>
</p>
<p><b>10 point lab</b>
</p>
<p>Post link to page in HAXcms site with the video included in<b> #lab11-accessibility</b>

      <title>W9 Drupal again</title>
      <link>/labs/lab-9-drupal-again</link>
      <description>
          <![CDATA[ <p>Drupal was both challenging and many wanted to learn more. As it's a much more complex system then the other CMSs we're covering, we're going to dedicate an additional class period JUST to doing more with Drupal.</p>
<p>For this lab we're going for technique and comprehension of what's happening with Drupal and in a use-case that's treating our website like an API.</p>
<p>We're going to build on the last lab where we started making a course schedule. Let's imagine that we're building a course scheduling system that is actually usable by humans (stretching your imagination, I know but stick with me, it's possible).</p>
<h2 id="header-2e167e6c-ac9b-0050-aa97-b32395bcadec">Lab Context <span>(purely hypothetical, NEVER happened before)</span></h2>
<p>In an alternative universe, you are the <b>site builder</b>
 that convinced the team <b>they COULD do</b>
 projects with Drupal. Even though you work for a marketing firm, your CEO enjoys money and hears higher education clients have a lot of it. Now that they <b><i>know</i>
 based on 1 week experience</b>
 that you can pull off complex technical projects in the "market vertical" and respond to an RFP from a large land grant university to redo their course scheduling system called "PionLath".</p>
<p>"PionLath" has been an utter UX disaster.<b> It doesn't model user roles </b>
correctly of the organization and has poor permission support within those roles. It also doesn't allow for <b>web services and APIs</b>
 to get data back out of it in new and meaningful ways. The university wants to get data out in a format that can be displayed on signage around the university but also just to ensure they aren't locked into the horrific UX patterns they currently experience with "PionLath".</p>
<p>They are looking for a solution that is cost effective given the multiple-millions of dollars spent on "PionLath" and the relative dislike of it by uhh... everyone. (again, totally hypothetical, this really isn't a problem that's ever happened at a <b>large land grant institution</b>
)</p>
<p>You easily win the bid because you've got a fantastic proposal writer, a cool sounding company and use words in marketing like "leader" and "synergy" and now you're ready to dig your claws into..err... help empower this large land grant institution.</p>
<h2 id="header-0317d0fb-0f0b-098c-8ef3-0498019da4bd">Synergistically doing more Leader'ing with Drupal</h2>
<p>Here's what we need to do this week and will walk through together in class. We need to:</p>
<ul><li>Create roles for Instructor, Parent, Student, Administrator</li>
<li>Change permissions for Instructors to be able to create new courses</li>
<li>Add an image field to our <b>course</b>
 to better market it</li>
<li>Enable these modules: Update Manager, HTTP Basic Authentication, JSON:API, RESTful Web Services, Serialization</li>
<li>Go to Reports ->Available Updates (admin/reports/updates) and hit<b> + Install new module or theme</b>
</li>
<li>Install the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/cors">CORS module for Drupal</a>
 - by copy and pasting this https://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/cors-8.x-1.0.tar.gz</li>
<li>Enable the CORS module</li>
<li>Go to the CORS settings page (admin/config/services/cors) and make sure that it says the following value: *|*</li>
<li>Clear caches (a common operation in drupal for things like this) admin/config/development/performance and hit clear cache. <b>Configuration -> Development -> Performance</b>
</li>
<li>Here's a resource for all things Drupal + JSONAPI as far as how to construct paths for reference: <a href="https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/modules/jsonapi/fetching-resources-get">https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/modules/jsonapi/fetching-resources-get</a>

      <description>
          <![CDATA[ <p style="width: 100%;">We'll cover user experience and generating ways of improving the platform by creating issues about any confusion you've run into when using the platform. <i>Open critique is the best way to improve! </i>
This is also practicing a technique called User Story Elicitation / Generation, common in the testing and development of any product.</p>
<p style="width: 100%;">In class portion to be done using <a href="https://hax.psu.edu/login">https://hax.psu.edu/login</a>

<p style="width: 100%;"><i>You may complete this using <a href="https://hax.psu.edu/login" style="width: 100%;">hax.psu.edu</a>
. Reclaim hosting is running several versions behind on HAXcms at the moment.</i>
</p>
<p style="width: 100%;"><b>HAXcms</b>
 is a highly flexible, organic static site solution. Because this is a new breed of authoring experience, it needs explaining and people to utilize the tool in different contexts to fully realize it's potential.</p>
<p style="width: 100%;">As HAX and HAXcms are being developed by the university to improve time on task, increase creativity in course design and help students present themselves online, you can complete this through any of the following scenarios.</p>
<h2 id="header-2e18814f-97fb-48a9-c6f9-f7c36303cfe0" style="width: 100%;"><b>Scenario: "Online course for helping in a crisis"</b>
</h2>
<p style="width: 100%;">Instructors don't want to learn new technologies that might get in the way of teaching. They want platforms that are simple to use, recognizable, and that will last. They've seen the ages of LMSs and having to port content to and from CMS solutions in the past. As a result, they need reassurance that HAXcms is easy to use and that it'll be an engaging way for them to teach.</p>
<p style="width: 100%;">For the purposes of this assignment, we'll take "engaging" to mean that it links to other sources, pulls in media like images and video, embeds wikipedia, has interactive question and answer segments; things like that. There are a few themes that make sense for presenting an online course but your welcome to use which ever theme you'd like.</p>
<p style="width: 100%;">Create a  ~<b>10-15 page online learning resource </b>
that teaches people about a topic that is in the news a lot and that is causing a lot of misinformation..</p>
<h3 id="header-ca04d9de-c518-3c98-ea0b-8b840b2d9439" style="width: 100%;">Topic</h3>
<ul style="width: 100%;"><li>A fact driven information site assembled about <b>COVID19</b>
 that could help others get relevant information to make better decisions about community health.</li>
<ul><li>Select sources that are not just major media sources. You can include some but lean toward research and source articles. CDC, other countries CDC equivalent, vaccine progress, models of impact of social distancing, things like this. Not just "STOCK MARKET DOWN" and "AIRPORT CLOSE" as so much of the news is right now. For example, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32150748">NIH incubation period analysis</a>
 suggesting most cases are ~5 days as opposed to the widely reported 2 weeks (which while possible, is far far less frequent).</li>
<li>This can include information that is geographic specific to yourself and your situation (make it personal). If you live in rural Kansas you have very different distancing considerations than inner city Philadelphia, London, or Queens. The more localized the better chance of connecting with people that know and trust you. <a href="https://oer.psu.edu/find/">PSU has a resource listing other</a>
 OER sources to help find things as well.</li>
<li>Tone should be one about this being serious but not scary. We can help people connect with reality more through the personal trust they have in who is assembling the work</li>
<li>Video / Pictures / graphics are important, HAXcms also includes a "Self check", "Stop note", "Multiple Choice", "Citation" and more which can help make content more interactive and engaging.</li>
<li>Explaining and linking off to where media is from is also important to ensure people can discover on their own and learn from trusted sources. We're all supposed to be on lock down so we have time to invest in hoping around to primary articles.</li>
<li><b>You can actually impact the lives of people around you with this so please take it seriously</b>
. Assemble information in a relevant way, present the case, share out on social media / email to friends and family. <i>Working to improve our reality is why we seek an education</i>
. It helps give us purpose. Find that purpose this week and channel it through your work to make a positive impact in a troubled word.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h2 id="header-83318f78-18bd-c3b6-71e0-fbaa4639cb59" style="width: 100%;">Video submission</h2>
<p style="width: 100%;">You'll be creating two videos this week. One relevant to the platform so that we can get feedback, but more importantly one geared toward other students, friends, family and society that needs you. We need your voice to help everyone through what is to come. We can make a positive difference.</p>
<ul style="width: 100%;"><li><b>Your Experience</b>
<span>
 - Describe your frustrations in using HAXcms. What made sense immediately? What took some time to figure out? What's something that worked really well? What's something that still doesn't make sense to you? What did you want it to do that it was missing? 2-3 minutes</span></li>
<li><b>Empowerment</b>
 - We must remain calm and strong in times of trouble to help keep fear from spreading. Explain how friends and family can use technology to remain connected to one another in this crisis, maybe how you plan to, what to watch on streaming services to pass the time, games and activities to connect you with friends remotely, and how to remain active in supporting your local economy. This may not seem like something you'd do in college for credit, which is exactly why it's so important that we do it now. Education is about the pursuit of information and converting that information into knowledge and this knowledge literally has the power to save lives. 2-3 minutes</li>
</ul>
<p style="width: 100%;"><b><i>
What didn't work or what you ran into issues using the platform are critical to our team getting user feedback and improving.</i>
</b>
<br/></p>
<h2 id="header-1b9e4123-7b55-af55-39f5-5046be7e2825" style="width: 100%;">Submitting this Lab</h2>
<p>Embed your YouTube video on the homepage of your HAXcms site.</p>
<p style="width: 100%;">Submit a link to your HAXcms site to the <b>#lab9-haxtheweb</b>
 channel on slack</p>
<p style="width: 100%;"><b>*Note on current events: </b>
please consider using social media to send out links to your resource after posting and using relevant hashtags. Sunshine is a good disinfectant for the fear that is propagating society right now and creating a factual resource you could send to your friends and relatives has far greater importance then this silly class.</p>
<h2 id="header-32687e69-1d24-97e1-f989-1e0130ec742f"><b>Grading the Lab</b>
</h2>
<p style="width: 100%;">Did you do the exercise from class on user story creation, create a site HAXcms and post your link to the channel<b> (2pts)</b>
</p>
<p style="width: 100%;">Did you create an engaging site that teaches someone facts and progress toward curing COVID and is it something that helps stitch together and generate new meaning for those looking for fast resources to access critical knowledge from trusted sources? <b>(6pts)</b>
</p>
<p style="width: 100%;">Did you record two videos; one with your experience and feedback on using the platform and another pointing to the positive ways that technology can help keep us safe and informed during these difficult times? <b>(2pts, 1 per video)</b>
</p>
<p style="width: 100%;"><b>Special note</b>
: You will not be evaluated based on your opinion of the platform. If you have a horrible experience or don't like it or something is difficult, <b>be honest</b>
. We grow from critique far more then fake-positive reviews. You are evaluated based on GIVING AN OPINION, implementing the solution, utilizing it, and backing up your perspective :)</p>
<p style="width: 100%;">No you will not be graded on your usage of social media, but it is highly recommended you use it in order to help spread the word about the importance of whats going on.</p>

<li>Drupal week two slides</li>
</ul>
<p>Drupal is the worlds most powerful, most complex and as a result, the most expensive CMS. We'll explore Drupal's concepts and do some data modeling together in class. Then we'll use Drupal to model those relationships in the website.</p>
<p>We'll learn about Content Types and fields to model data. Then we'll use Views in order to visualize that data and work with content entry to make sense of it all.</p>
<p>Drupal is daunting at first but once you learn the concepts and experience them they form a repeatable pattern of development and site building that leads you into a large community with lots of financial opportunities.</p>

      <description>
          <![CDATA[ <p style=""><span>Lecture slides from this week</span></p>
<p>This week we'll be covering WordPress, the worlds most widely used open source CMS. WordPress is great for simple websites of which the web is made up of many. It's why it powers (estimates, numbers differ by source) 33% to as much as 50% of sites on the internet.</p>
<p>These sites could be everything from the Whitehouse down to every individual blog / new acount on wordpress.com (SaaS solution version) which is why people take some of that number with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>It's a great platform to start your own website on but it's run into some recent controversies which are worth exploring - namely the battle for the heart of the community around a text editor. It's weird to think about, but when a CMS lives and dies by the ease of content entry, you can understand why the <b>new core mandatory</b>
 text editor called<b> Gutenberg</b>
 would attract positive and negative attention.</p>
<p>With plans to phase out the "Classic Editor" in 2020 many people in the community are at a cross-roads: Continue to trust the same core community that "took away" their beloved simple HTML editor, or forge a new path. We'll look briefly at the concept of community forks through the context of ClassicPress, a popular WordPress alternative that's gaining traction as the more community centric CMS.</p>
<p>With parallels to Drupal and it's popular fork Backdrop (topic for next lab) we'll see that it's not always code that leads to inflection points in groups but the process by which that code is formed, agreed upon, and ultimately pushed into the main project everyone's aligned with.</p>
<p>WordPress is a great resume builder both in terms of the platform as well as putting on your resume that you have experience with it, so let's dig in and check it out in <a href="https://reclaimhosting.com/">ReclaimHosting</a>
 once more!</p>
